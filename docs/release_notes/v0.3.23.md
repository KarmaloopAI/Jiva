# Jiva v0.3.23 - Linux Support & Dependency Fixes

**Release Date:** February 27, 2026  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

## Overview

This release fixes several issues related to older packages and a bug on Linux machines where Jiva was reading the wrong directory on startup.

## Changes

### Bug Fixes

#### Linux Filesystem Path Fix
- Added `src/utils/platform.ts` utility to detect the operating system and resolve paths correctly across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Fixed the workspace and allowed-paths logic in `src/interfaces/cli/index.ts` and `src/interfaces/http/session-manager.ts` so that Jiva no longer tries to read the wrong directory on startup on Linux hosts
- Fixed a `mustUseTools` type error in `src/core/client-agent.ts` that caused unexpected behaviour on stricter TypeScript targets

#### Punycode Deprecation Fix
- Fixed the `[DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The punycode module is deprecated` Node.js warning by lazy-loading `@google-cloud/storage` in `src/storage/gcp-bucket-provider.ts` — the import is deferred until the provider is actually used, so the deprecated built-in `punycode` module is never loaded during CLI-only sessions

### CI/CD

- Added `.github/workflows/npm-publish-dev.yml`: a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and publishes the package to npm with a `dev` pre-release tag whenever a commit is merged into the `develop` branch, enabling early access to the latest changes without affecting the stable channel

## Upgrade Instructions

```bash
npm install -g jiva-core@0.3.23
```

## Notes for Linux Users

If you were seeing errors like `ENOENT: no such file or directory` or Jiva reading from an unexpected path at startup, upgrading to v0.3.23 resolves the issue. No configuration changes are required.
