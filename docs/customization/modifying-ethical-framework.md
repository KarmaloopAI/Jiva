# Modifying the Ethical Framework

The Jiva Framework includes an ethical framework that guides the agent's decision-making process. This document explains how to modify and extend this framework to suit your specific needs and ethical standards.

## Understanding the Ethical Framework

The ethical framework in Jiva is implemented in the `core/ethical_framework.py` file. It uses a set of predefined principles to evaluate the ethical implications of tasks and actions.

## Steps to Modify the Ethical Framework

1. **Locate the Ethical Framework File**: 
   Navigate to `core/ethical_framework.py` in your Jiva project directory.

2. **Understand the Current Implementation**:
   The `EthicalFramework` class contains methods like `evaluate_task`, `evaluate_action`, and `get_ethical_explanation`.

3. **Modify Ethical Principles**:
   Update the `ethical_principles` list in the `__init__` method or in the config file:

   ```python
   self.ethical_principles = config.get('principles', [
       "Respect user privacy",
       "Promote truthfulness",
       "Avoid harm",
       "Foster inclusivity"
   ])
   ```

4. **Customize Evaluation Logic**:
   Modify the `evaluate_task` and `evaluate_action` methods to implement your specific ethical reasoning:

   ```python
   def evaluate_task(self, task: Union[str, Dict[str, Any]]) -> bool:
       # Your custom evaluation logic here
       # Example:
       if "collect personal data" in str(task).lower():
           return False  # Reject tasks that collect personal data
       return True
   ```

5. **Enhance Ethical Explanations**:
   Update the `get_ethical_explanation` method to provide more detailed or specific explanations:

   ```python
   def get_ethical_explanation(self, task_or_action: str, is_task: bool = True) -> str:
       # Your custom explanation logic here
       # Example:
       if "collect personal data" in task_or_action.lower():
           return "This action is not allowed as it violates user privacy principles."
       return "This action aligns with our ethical guidelines."
   ```

6. **Add New Ethical Checks**:
   Implement new methods for specific ethical considerations:

   ```python
   def check_data_privacy(self, action: str) -> bool:
       # Implement logic to check if the action respects data privacy
       pass
   ```

7. **Update Configuration**:
   Ensure your `config.json` file reflects any changes to the ethical framework:

   ```json
   "ethical_framework": {
       "enabled": true,
       "principles": [
           "Respect user privacy",
           "Promote truthfulness",
           "Avoid harm",
           "Foster inclusivity"
       ]
   }
   ```

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Ensure your modifications are consistent with the overall goals and values of your Jiva implementation.
- **Transparency**: Document any changes you make to the ethical framework, explaining the reasoning behind new or modified principles.
- **Testing**: After making changes, thoroughly test the ethical framework to ensure it behaves as expected in various scenarios.
- **Flexibility**: Design your modifications to be adaptable, as ethical considerations may evolve over time.
- **User Awareness**: If your modifications significantly change Jiva's behavior, ensure users are aware of these changes.

## Example: Adding a Fairness Check

Here's an example of how you might add a fairness check to the ethical framework:

```python
class EthicalFramework:
    # ... existing code ...

    def check_fairness(self, action: str, parameters: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """
        Check if an action promotes fairness and non-discrimination.
        
        Args:
            action (str): The name of the action.
            parameters (Dict[str, Any]): The parameters of the action.
        
        Returns:
            bool: True if the action is considered fair, False otherwise.
        """
        # Example implementation
        sensitive_attributes = ["race", "gender", "age", "religion"]
        for attr in sensitive_attributes:
            if attr in str(parameters).lower():
                return False  # Action may lead to unfair treatment
        return True

    def evaluate_action(self, action: str, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        # ... existing code ...
        if not self.check_fairness(action, params):
            return False
        # ... rest of the evaluation ...
```

By modifying the ethical framework, you can ensure that Jiva's decision-making aligns with your specific ethical standards and requirements.
