## Automatic Features

These work without any configuration:

### 1. Auto-Save
Every time you chat, the conversation is saved.

### 2. Auto-Condense
When conversation hits 30 messages, older messages are condensed into a summary.

### 3. Mission Completion
Agent won't stop until task is done (or asks for help).

### 4. Markdown Rendering
All markdown is automatically formatted.

---

## Configuration (Optional)

Want to customize? Edit when creating agent:

```typescript
const agent = new JivaAgent({
  orchestrator,
  mcpManager,
  workspace,
  conversationManager,
  autoSave: true,              // Default: true
  condensingThreshold: 30,     // Default: 30 messages
  maxIterations: 10,           // Default: 10
  temperature: 0.7,            // Default: 0.7
});
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Conversations Not Saving?

Check if directory exists:
```bash
ls ~/.jiva/conversations/
```

If not, create it:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.jiva/conversations
```

### Markdown Not Rendering?

Rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Use `list` Often
See what conversations you have:
```
You: list
```

### 2. Name Your Workspace
Run Jiva from your project directory so conversations are tagged:
```bash
cd ~/dev/MyProject
npx jiva chat
```

### 3. Let Auto-Save Work
Don't worry about manual saves - it's automatic!

### 4. Trust the Mission-Driven Agent
Let it work through problems. It will ask if it needs help.
