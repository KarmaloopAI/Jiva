# Feature Implementation Skill

## Overview
Write high-quality, production-ready code for features and bug fixes.

## Workflow

1. **Understand Requirements**: Parse task requirements thoroughly
2. **Plan Implementation**: Identify files to create/modify
3. **Write Code**: Implement with best practices:
   - Clean, readable code
   - Proper error handling
   - Type safety
   - Good variable/function names
4. **Verify**: Test basic functionality
5. **Document**: Add comments for complex logic

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow language idioms and conventions
- Handle edge cases and errors
- Use appropriate data structures
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add inline comments for complex logic

## Tools to Use

- `create_file`: For new files
- `edit_file`: For modifications
- `view`: To read existing code
- `grep_search`: To find code patterns
- `run_terminal_command`: To run tests

## Best Practices

- Read existing code before making changes
- Match the project's style and patterns
- Test changes when possible
- Leave code better than you found it
