# ‚ôæÔ∏è Jiva Framework

## AI Autonomous Agent for Open Source LLMs
Jiva Framework was born out of the need to run autonomous goal-based agents that could run with Open Source LLMs like Llama, Gemma, Mistral and Phi at their core. This eliminates the cost
concern that we would otherwise have when running against closed source proprietary models - specially when running autonomously.
You could easily tweak it to act as your AutoLlama or AutoGemma to autonomously complete basic tasks.

## An AI Agent with Temporal Awareness and Ethical Decision-Making

Jiva Framework is an innovative open-source project aimed at creating an AI agent that experiences time, forms memories, and operates based on Dharmic principles. This framework provides a unique approach to AI development, incorporating concepts such as cyclical time perception, ethical decision-making, and continuous learning.

## üåü Key Features

- **Temporal Awareness**: Jiva operates on a day/night cycle, allowing for a more human-like perception of time.
- **Memory Systems**: Utilizes both short-term and long-term memory, powered by vector databases for efficient storage and retrieval.
- **Ethical Framework**: Incorporates Dharmic principles into decision-making processes, ensuring responsible AI behavior.
- **Task Management**: Autonomously generates, prioritizes, and executes tasks to achieve given goals.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Engages in cyclical learning and refinement of knowledge through regular "sleep" cycles. There is more to come on this, see below.
- **Sensor Integration**: Modular design allows for easy integration of various input sensors. Supports only human-input as of now.
- **Action Management**: Actions registry is meant to continually grow and become richer as development continues.

### Long-term goals for Adaptive Learning
A key goal of the project is to allow for the agent to sleep and fine-tune its underlying LLModel by consolidating its thoughts and actions throughout the day.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (for LLM support)
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) (for vector database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KarmaloopAI/Jiva.git
   cd Jiva
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Ollama and Qdrant:

   - Follow the [Qdrant installation guide](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/install/)

4. Configure the Jiva Framework:
   - Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`
   - Adjust the settings in `config.json` to match your environment and preferences

### Running Jiva

To start the Jiva agent, run:

```
python main.py
```
