# Jiva Framework

## üß† An AI Agent with Temporal Awareness and Ethical Decision-Making

Jiva Framework is an innovative open-source project aimed at creating an AI agent that experiences time, forms memories, and operates based on Dharmic principles. This framework provides a unique approach to AI development, incorporating concepts such as cyclical time perception, ethical decision-making, and continuous learning.

## üåü Key Features

- **Temporal Awareness**: Jiva operates on a day/night cycle, allowing for a more human-like perception of time.
- **Memory Systems**: Utilizes both short-term and long-term memory, powered by vector databases for efficient storage and retrieval.
- **Ethical Framework**: Incorporates Dharmic principles into decision-making processes, ensuring responsible AI behavior.
- **Task Management**: Autonomously generates, prioritizes, and executes tasks to achieve given goals.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Engages in cyclical learning and refinement of knowledge through regular "sleep" cycles.
- **Sensor Integration**: Modular design allows for easy integration of various input sensors.
- **Action Management**: Ethical evaluation of actions before execution, with support for file operations and potential for expansion.
